Randomized Complete Block Design
--------------------------------
Blocks correspond to clusters of units with similar traits
e.g. block by age or district of residence

Treatments are assigned at random within each block

Then, Y = u + T + B + e
Y = outcome
u = grand mean
T = treatment effect
B = block effect
e = random error

Whitefly setup
--------------
3 blocks, 6 units each, 6 treatments
repeated measures over 12 weeks
